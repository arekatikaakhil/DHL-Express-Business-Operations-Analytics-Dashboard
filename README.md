## Data Model

The dashboard is powered by a **star schema data model**, ensuring efficiency and simplicity.

### Tables

* **Fact Table:**

  * `Orders`: Transactional data, calculated fields, and KPIs

* **Dimension Tables:**

  * `Shipping`: Shipping mode, delivery times, and status
  * `Customers`: Segments, region, city, and geographic details
  * `Products`: Product names, categories, departments, and prices
  * `Department`: Department-level attributes and locations
  * `DateTable`: Calendar table for time-series analysis (month, quarter, year)

This model improves performance and supports robust DAX calculations for KPIs and trends.
